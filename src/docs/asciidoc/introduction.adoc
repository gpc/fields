The Grails scaffolding core module was created to render 3 separate views: list, show, and create/edit. By default the views are rendered in a similar way to the fields plugin. All of the applicable rules of the fields plugin also apply to this module.

Scaffolding core is designed to render markup intended to be processed by a template engine. The classes provided by this library will always render markup based on the definition of a domain class, instead of an individual instance or instances of a domain class that contain real data.

This user guide will cover how this library works along with how developers can extend it to completely customize the results.
