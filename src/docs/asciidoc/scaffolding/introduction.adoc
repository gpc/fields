The Grails scaffolding core module was created to render 3 separate views: list, show, and create/edit. By default the views are rendered in a similar way to the link:https://grails-fields-plugin.github.io/grails-fields/[fields] plugin. All of the applicable rules of the link:https://grails-fields-plugin.github.io/grails-fields/[fields] plugin also apply to this module.

Scaffolding core is designed to render markup intended to be processed by a template engine. The classes provided by this library will always render markup based on the definition of a domain class, instead of an individual instance or instances of a domain class that contain real data.

This user guide will cover how this library works along with how developers can extend it to completely customize the results.
